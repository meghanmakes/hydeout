In April 2015, a devastating earthquake hit Nepal. At the time, I had just left a
job working in Singapore and was travelling South East Asia with only a flexible
plan in place. When I heard the news, I wanted to see if I could do something to
help. I ended up going to Nepal and working with a local NGO called Hand in
Hands Volunteer Society to contribute to disaster relief efforts. You can read
