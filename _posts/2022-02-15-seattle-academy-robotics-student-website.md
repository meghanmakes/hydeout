title: Seattle Academy Robotics Student Resource Website

Students at Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences (SAAS) can participate in engineering
and robotics through a variety of different programs. This website was used as a
place to post reference material for students doing robotics at both the middle
and high school levels in both classes and clubs. It was originally created as 
a website for middle school students to use but was eventually used for both 
middle and high school students. Since everyone already knew the website name as 
SAAS MS Robotics, the name stuck.

There are tutorials, walk-throughs, example code, project ideas, circuit diagrams,
and more for Metro Express Boards, the MicroBit Hummingbird, and LEGO EV3 Robots.
As the robotics director at SAAS, I created all of the content on this website.
