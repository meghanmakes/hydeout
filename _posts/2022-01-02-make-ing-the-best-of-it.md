At the start of the pandemic I was running a makerspace for a nursery through 12th grade school.
When the school closed down I wanted to find a way to stay connected with not only the students
who were in my classes and clubs, but the students who came to hang out in the lab during their
free time and younger students came in to the makerspace to do projects with their teachers. I
decided to create a video series called "MAKE-ing the Best of It" which turned into a 25 video 
series of project ideas and instructions. Every project was something that could be done at home
with minimal special materials. There are a variety of projects, some are longer and some are 
shorter. Some are easy and some are hard. Some have lots of directions and some are a super short
video with an idea to go forward with. Here is a video I made on how to build a tensegrity
structure:

While I was doing this I had also setup all of the 
makerspace's 3D printers in my basement and started printing faceshields to help local medical
facilities that needed them. The video that I've linked to below is a walk through of how 3D 
printing and resin casting works, which is how I was making face shields:
