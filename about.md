  Hi! My name is Meghan and I use they/them pronouns. I am an engineer with expertise in embedded systems and digital electronics as well as experience in a broad range of engineering fields. I have worked on projects ranging from a neural prosthesis to a minimally invasive brain tumor removal device. I am particularly interested in fast paced, challenging work environments where the goal is to create technology that will have a positive impact on society.

Working at a number of elite private schools, my specialization for the past seven years has been designing and teaching curriculum around robotics and embedded systems. I have taught students how to make their own circuit boards, model custom robot parts in Solidworks, program complex arrays of sensors, and even make their own microprocessor core on an FPGA. My work as a teacher has made me a flexible and creative engineer with excellent communication skills. I am currently running an engineering and robotics program for a school in Seattle, WA.
