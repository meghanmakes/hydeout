I"–<p>At The Wheeler School I taught an 8th grade technology core class and eventually settled 
on using Adafruit Circuit Playground Express (CPX) Boards as a basis for the class. I had 
previously experimented with using Arduinos and other similar boards for this class
but found that the CPX was a much easier entry point for most students. The CPX can be
programmed in Circuit Python, which was a great continuation of my 7th grad tech core course, 
and does not require students to do any wiring but they can still experiment with sensors. This
made it an ideal board for this class. You can see some of the lessons for this class in this
video series:</p>
