I"Æ	<p>Schools often have schedules that are extremely difficult to put into a calendar. Whether
they are rolling, tumbling, or some other kind of schedule, Google often doesnâ€™t have a
built-in method to handle the many, extremely specific things that are helpful for putting
a school schedule into a calendar. In fall 2020, I decided to program something that would
make it easier. In true personal project style, it turned into a task that was much harder
than just putting my classes into my calendar when I decided to turn it into a Flask app
that anyone at the school could use to put in the names of their classes, check options for
which things like lunch, breaks, etc. they wanted added, and then generate a custom calendar
file that they could import into their calendar software of choice! It was a lot of work since
I had no experience with Flask before starting this project but I had a lot of fun making it. 
I used to have this hosted through PythonAnywhere but it is no longer hosted anywhere. I stopped 
updating the calendar creator because the schedule changed so many times throughout the year due to 
COVID that I couldnâ€™t keep up. However, I do still occasional have someone email me to ask if 
Iâ€™m planning to update it any time soon so I would say it was definitely a success. Here is a link 
to the code on GitHub if you would like to take a look:</p>
