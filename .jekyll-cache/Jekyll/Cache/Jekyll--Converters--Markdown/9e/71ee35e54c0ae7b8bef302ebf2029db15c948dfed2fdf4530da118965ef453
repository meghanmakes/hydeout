I"¼<p>Although I have taught many subjects, from physics to web design, I have found that CAD
has the widest spread in terms of how long students take to learn the subject. Some students
take to the subject instantly and move very quickly while others need a lot more time to
get the hang of it. There are also a lot of very precise, important steps that need to be 
followed exactly or nothing works properly. After seeing that traditional lecture and 
demonstration methods of teaching CAD were not working as well as I wanted them to be, I 
decided to try recording videos of myself teaching CAD so that students could follow
along at their own pace. The difference was amazing. Suddenly, I was able to both teach
every student at their own pace through the videos and go around and answer any questions that
came up individually. Currently, the FRC team that I coach uses Solidworks which we have
access to through a sponsorship. My classes use OnShape because they are able to get free access
with their .edu email addresses and it is entirely accessible online so there is no need
for students to download anything to their computers.</p>

<p>Here is the Introduction to OnShape that I use with my Introduction to Engineering class which
focuses mostly on custom part design:</p>
