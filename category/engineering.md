I graduated with a degree in Engineering from Harvey Mudd College in 2014.
I specialized in digital electronics and biomedical engineering and worked
on some really cool projects before moving to a career in teaching. This page
features my professional engineering work. For personal projects, see the
Personal Projects page.
